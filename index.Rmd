### What is this course about?

This course is intended for [people](personas.html) who use spreadsheets for data manipulation and have never programmed, but would like to learn how to work with R. Therefore its starts from the beginning: why use R? and where to start?

We propose to work with R in an orderly and reproducible way. For this reason, we present a workflow that allows those who take this course to apply good programming practices, work collaboratively and present their work in a single document that includes the analysis and the results.

Whenever we can, we will mention how what we propose to solve with R can also be done with spreadsheets and the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

In each section we include activities along with examples. We want these exercises to be realistic so that anyone can find similarities in their own data and can apply what they have learned to other situations.

### Before we start

During this workshop we will use RStudio Cloud.  If you want to use your computer we will use R and RStudio. Please [follow these instructions to prepare for the workshop](prepare.html).
